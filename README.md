# EDGE FastVPINNs

## Description
This repository contains implementations of FastVPINNs (Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks) for solving various problems on edge devices. The main focus is on solving the Convection-Diffusion equation and predicting space-dependent diffusion parameters using blockwise implementations.

## Folder Structure
- **forward_gear**: Contains files to solve the Convection-Diffusion 2D (CD2D) on gear geometry.
- **inverse_gear**: Contains files to predict space-dependent diffusion parameters.
- **blockwise_vpinns**: Contains codes for blockwise implementation of FastVPINNs, enabling them to run efficiently on edge devices.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the individual README files or scripts.
