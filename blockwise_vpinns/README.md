# Blockwise FastVPINNs 

This project contains the blockwise implementation of the Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs).

## Files

- **Main File**: `main_blockwise.py`
    - This is the main script that runs the blockwise VPINNs implementation.
    
- **Model File**: `model_gear_blockwise.py`
    - This file contains the model architecture and related functions for the blockwise VPINNs.
    
- **Datahandler File**: `datahandler.py`
    - This file is responsible for handling the data and ensuring the blockwise implementation is correctly managed.

The `datahandler.py` file takes care of the blockwise implementation, ensuring that data is processed and fed into the model in a blockwise manner.
